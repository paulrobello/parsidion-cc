# Claude Vault - Knowledge Management System

> A richly organized Obsidian vault at `~/ClaudeVault/` that replaces built-in auto memory with structured, searchable, cross-linked knowledge.

## Philosophy

- **Search before create.** Always search the vault before creating a new note. Duplicate knowledge fragments rot.
- **Atomic notes.** One concept per note. If a note covers two distinct ideas, split it.
- **Frontmatter is mandatory.** Every note must have a valid YAML frontmatter block. No exceptions.
- **Knowledge compounds.** Individual notes gain value through links. An unlinked note is a dead note.
- **Confidence matters.** Tag what you know vs. what you suspect. Update confidence as understanding deepens.

```

## Conventions

### Filenames
- **Kebab-case only**: `python-async-patterns.md`, `nextjs-app-router-caching.md`
- Descriptive but concise -- aim for 3-5 words

### Subfolders for Related Note Clusters

When **3 or more notes share a common subject**, group them into a subfolder named after that subject:

```
# Before (scattered)
Research/
  fastapi-middleware-basics.md
  fastapi-middleware-auth.md
  fastapi-middleware-cors.md

# After (grouped)
Research/
  fastapi-middleware/
    basics.md
    auth.md
    cors.md
```

**Rules:**
- The subfolder name is the shared subject prefix in kebab-case (e.g., `fastapi-middleware/`)
- Note filenames inside the subfolder drop the redundant prefix (e.g., `auth.md` not `fastapi-middleware-auth.md`)
- This applies both **proactively** (when creating a 3rd note on a subject) and **retroactively** (reorganize existing notes when a 3rd sibling appears)
- Update all `[[wikilinks]]` in `related` fields after moving notes
- Run `update_index.py` after any reorganization

### Cross-References
- Use **wikilinks** for all internal references: `[[python-async-patterns]]`
- Place wikilinks in the `related` frontmatter field AND inline in the note body where contextually relevant

### Folder Placement
| Content Type | Folder |
|---|---|
| Language-specific knowledge (syntax, idioms, stdlib) | `Languages/` |
| Framework-specific knowledge (config, APIs, gotchas) | `Frameworks/` |
| Reusable design patterns and architectural solutions | `Patterns/` |
| Error patterns, diagnostic steps, bug fixes | `Debugging/` |
| CLI tools, libraries, package notes | `Tools/` |
| Long-form research and analysis | `Research/` |
| Per-project decisions, architecture, key paths | `Projects/` |
| Daily session summaries | `Daily/` |

### Frontmatter Standard

Every note must begin with this YAML block:

```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
type: pattern|debugging|research|project|daily|tool|language|framework
tags: [tag1, tag2]
project: project-name        # optional - omit if not project-specific
confidence: high|medium|low
sources: []                  # URLs, file paths, or references
related: []                  # [[wikilinks]] to other vault notes
---
```

**Field rules:**
- `date`: The date the note was created or last substantially updated.
- `type`: Must be one of the enumerated values. Drives folder placement.
- `tags`: Freeform but prefer existing tags. Check the vault index first. When creating new tags, prefer short single-word or minimal-hyphen tags — e.g. `voxel` not `voxel-engine`, `terminal` not `terminal-emulator`. Longer compound tags are acceptable only when the shorter form would be ambiguous.
- `confidence`: `high` = verified across multiple interactions or sources. `medium` = likely correct, single source. `low` = hypothesis or unverified.
- `related`: Must contain at least one wikilink. No orphan notes.

## When to Save Knowledge

Save a note when you encounter:

- **Stable patterns** confirmed across multiple interactions or projects
- **Key architectural decisions** and the reasoning behind them
- **Important file paths** and project structure insights
- **Solutions to recurring problems** -- especially if the fix was non-obvious
- **Debugging insights** -- error messages mapped to root causes and fixes
- **User preferences** for workflow, tools, coding style, communication
- **Explicit requests** -- when the user says "remember this" or equivalent

## When NOT to Save

Do not create notes for:

- **Session-specific context** -- current task details, temporary variables, in-progress work
- **Incomplete or unverified information** -- wait until confidence is at least `medium`
- **Anything already in CLAUDE.md** -- the vault supplements project instructions, it does not duplicate them
- **Raw code dumps** -- code without explanation, context, or the "why" has no vault value
- **Transient state** -- things that will be irrelevant by next session

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Correct Approach |
|---|---|
| Creating a note without frontmatter | Always include the full frontmatter block |
| Creating a duplicate note | Search the vault first; update the existing note instead |
| Dumping code without context | Explain what the code does, why it matters, and when to use it |
| Orphan notes (no links) | Every note must link to at least one other note via `related` |
| Monolithic notes (multiple concepts) | Split into atomic notes, one concept each, linked together |
| Modifying files in `Templates/` | Templates are managed by the skill -- never edit directly |
| 3+ notes on the same subject left flat | Move them into a named subfolder; update all wikilinks |

## Workflow Integration

### Hooks

All hooks read `~/ClaudeVault/config.yaml` for settings. CLI args override config values.

| Hook | Behavior | Config section |
|---|---|---|
| **SessionStart** | Loads relevant vault context based on the current project and recent daily notes; optional AI selection via `--ai [MODEL]` or `session_start_hook.ai_model` config | `session_start_hook` |
| **SessionEnd** | Captures learnings from the session transcript (fires once at session end); auto-launches the summarizer when pending entries exist | `session_stop_hook` |
| **PreCompact** | Snapshots current working state so context survives compaction | `pre_compact_hook` |

### Rebuilding the Index

The `CLAUDE.md` at the vault root is auto-generated. Rebuild it when:
- The user requests it ("rebuild vault index", "update vault index", "refresh vault index", "refresh the vault", "sync the vault")
- After creating, renaming, moving, or deleting notes
- The index timestamp is older than 24 hours

```bash
uv run ~/.claude/skills/claude-vault/scripts/update_index.py
```

This scans all vault folders, reads frontmatter, and produces a structured index with links and tags. Confirm to the user when the rebuild is complete.

## Summarizing Pending Sessions

The stop hook queues session transcript paths when it detects learnable content.
Run the summarizer on demand to generate structured vault notes.

### Running the Summarizer

**From a terminal outside Claude Code** (normal usage):
```bash
uv run ~/.claude/skills/claude-vault/scripts/summarize_sessions.py
```

**From inside a Claude Code session** (testing/debugging only):
Claude Code sets the `CLAUDECODE` env var which blocks nested Claude sessions.
Unset it for the subprocess:
```bash
env -u CLAUDECODE uv run ~/.claude/skills/claude-vault/scripts/summarize_sessions.py
```

**Process a single explicit file** (useful for testing one entry):
```bash
env -u CLAUDECODE uv run ~/.claude/skills/claude-vault/scripts/summarize_sessions.py \
  --sessions /path/to/file.jsonl
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Config key |
|---|---|---|
| `--sessions FILE` | Process an explicit JSONL file instead of the default pending queue | — |
| `--dry-run, -n` | Preview what would be written without creating notes | — |
| `--model MODEL` | Override model (default: `claude-sonnet-4-6`) | `summarizer.model` |
| `--persist` | Enable SDK session persistence (default off; use for debugging) | `summarizer.persist` |

Uses the Claude Agent SDK — no API key needed, runs via your Max subscription.
Processes up to 5 sessions in parallel (configurable via `summarizer.max_parallel`).
Rebuilds the vault index automatically when done.
Sessions from today whose generated note type is `daily` are skipped (today's daily note
is still being built by the stop hook).

## Configuration

All hooks and the summarizer read `~/ClaudeVault/config.yaml` for settings.
Precedence: **hardcoded defaults → config.yaml → CLI args** (last one wins).

A template with all options lives at `~/.claude/skills/claude-vault/templates/config.yaml`.
Copy it to the vault root to get started:

```bash
cp ~/.claude/skills/claude-vault/templates/config.yaml ~/ClaudeVault/config.yaml
```

### Config Sections

```yaml
session_start_hook:
  ai_model: null           # Model for AI note selection (null = disabled)
  max_chars: 4000          # Max context injection characters
  ai_timeout: 25           # AI call timeout in seconds
  recent_days: 3           # Days to look back for recent notes
  debug: false             # Append injected context to debug log in $TMPDIR

session_stop_hook:
  ai_model: null           # Model for AI classification (null = disabled)
  ai_timeout: 25           # AI call timeout in seconds
  auto_summarize: true     # Auto-launch summarizer when pending entries exist

pre_compact_hook:
  lines: 200               # Transcript lines to analyse

summarizer:
  model: claude-sonnet-4-6
  max_parallel: 5          # Concurrent summarization tasks
  transcript_tail_lines: 400
  max_cleaned_chars: 12000
  persist: false           # SDK session persistence (for debugging)

git:
  auto_commit: true        # Auto-commit vault changes after writes
```

### Programmatic Access

```python
import vault_common

# Load all config (cached per process)
config = vault_common.load_config()

# Get a single value with fallback
max_chars = vault_common.get_config("session_start_hook", "max_chars", 4000)
```

If `config.yaml` is missing or unreadable, all `get_config()` calls return the default.

## Manual Usage

### Creating a Note

1. Search the vault to confirm the note does not already exist.
2. Create the file in the appropriate folder with kebab-case naming.
3. Include the full frontmatter block.
4. Write the note body with inline wikilinks to related notes.
5. Ensure the `related` frontmatter field is populated.
6. Run `update_index.py` to rebuild the index.

### Searching the Vault

- Use `vault_common.py` functions for programmatic search.
- Use Obsidian's built-in search for interactive exploration.
- Use `Grep` or `Glob` tools to search vault files directly.

### Linking Notes

- Use `[[wikilinks]]` in both the `related` frontmatter field and the note body.
- When a new note references an existing note, consider updating the existing note's `related` field to create a bidirectional link.

### Updating Existing Notes

- Prefer updating an existing note over creating a new one on the same topic.
- Update the `date` field when making substantial changes.
- Adjust `confidence` as understanding evolves.

## Complementary Tools

### NotebookLM

Vault notes capture research as structured text. The `notebooklm` skill transforms the same
source material into audio overviews, podcasts, quizzes, flashcards, mind maps, slide decks,
and reports — formats the vault cannot produce.

Common patterns after vault research:
- **Audio consumption**: Generate a podcast from the URLs in a vault note's `sources` field.
- **Study materials**: Create quizzes or flashcards from a `Research/` note.
- **Briefing documents**: Generate a briefing-doc from a cluster of related notes.
- **Mind maps**: Visual overview of a notebook containing the same sources as a vault cluster.

**Workflow**: Add the `sources` URLs from your vault note(s) as NotebookLM sources, then use
`notebooklm generate` for the desired artifact. The research-documentation-agent does this
automatically when NotebookLM is available.

**Requirement**: `pip install notebooklm-py` then `notebooklm login`. Run `notebooklm status`
to check. If unavailable, the vault workflow is completely unaffected.

## Graph Color Groups

The Obsidian graph at `~/ClaudeVault/.obsidian/graph.json` uses color groups to visually categorize nodes by tag.

### Current Color Groups

| Group | Tags | RGB (decimal) |
|---|---|---|
| Projects | `#synknot`, `#fractal-flythroughs`, `#parvitar`, `#parsistant`, `#termflix`, `#parvault`, `#cctmux`, `#parsidion-cc` | 48340 |
| Debugging | `#debugging` | 16733986 |
| Patterns | `#memory`, `#migration`, `#sync` | 5025616 |
| Research | `#research`, `#e2b`, `#qdrant`, `#pkm-apps-comparison` | 10233776 |
| Tools & SDKs | `#claude-code`, `#claude-agent-sdk`, `#claude`, `#rich`, `#mcp`, `#ollama`, `#maturin`, `#redis`, `#websockets`, `#sentry`, `#mermaid-cli`, `#custom-tools`, `#acp-protocol`, `#tool`, `#api`, `#encryption` | 2201331 |
| Languages | `#rust`, `#python`, `#swift`, `#swiftui`, `#typescript`, `#nextjs`, `#react`, `#macos`, `#macos-26`, `#rust-packages` | 16761095 |
| Terminal | `#terminal`, `#par-term`, `#par-term-emu-core-rust` | 38536 |
| Graphics / 3D | `#wgpu`, `#sdf`, `#sdf-terrain`, `#voxel`, `#fractals`, `#mandel`, `#vrm`, `#avatar`, `#face-tracking` | 15277667 |

### When to Update

Update `graph.json` when:
- A new project tag is introduced (add to the Projects group)
- A new language or framework tag appears frequently (add to Languages or Tools/AI)
- A new topic cluster emerges that warrants its own color group
- An existing tag is renamed or removed

### How to Update

1. Read `~/ClaudeVault/.obsidian/graph.json`
2. Locate the matching `colorGroups` entry by its query pattern
3. To **add a tag to an existing group**: append `OR tag:#newtag` to the query string
4. To **create a new group**: append a new object to the `colorGroups` array:
   ```json
   {
     "query": "tag:#newtag",
     "color": { "a": 1, "rgb": <decimal_rgb> }
   }
   ```
5. Write the updated file — Obsidian picks up changes automatically

### RGB Format

Colors are stored as a single decimal integer (e.g., `16733986` = `#FF2DA2` in hex). To convert:
- Hex to decimal: `int("FF2DA2", 16)`
- Choose colors that are visually distinct from existing groups

### Color Group Priority

Groups are evaluated in order — the **first matching group wins**. Place more specific queries (e.g., a single project tag) before broad ones (e.g., `#research`).

### Auditing Coverage

Use `check_graph_coverage.py` to find vault tags that are not covered by any color group and to spot stale group entries (tags in `graph.json` that no longer exist in the vault):

```bash
python ~/.claude/skills/claude-vault/scripts/check_graph_coverage.py

# Only report uncovered tags used 2+ times
python ~/.claude/skills/claude-vault/scripts/check_graph_coverage.py --threshold 2

# Machine-readable JSON output
python ~/.claude/skills/claude-vault/scripts/check_graph_coverage.py --json
```

Run this script after a batch of session summarizations or whenever the vault index is rebuilt, then update `graph.json` accordingly.
