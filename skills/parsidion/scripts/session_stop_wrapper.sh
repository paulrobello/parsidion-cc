# SessionEnd hook wrapper — reads stdin, acknowledges immediately, then runs
# the real session_stop_hook.py detached so Claude Code's exit sequence
# cannot cancel it before it completes.
#
# Claude Code fires SessionEnd and waits for the hook to output JSON and exit.
# If the hook is slow to start (e.g. uv startup overhead) Claude Code may
# cancel it during its own shutdown.  This wrapper solves that by:
#   1. Saving stdin to a temp file before outputting anything.
#   2. Writing {} to stdout immediately so Claude Code sees a clean exit.
#   3. Spawning the real Python hook in a detached background process.
