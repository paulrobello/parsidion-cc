# Git Diff Viewer — Design Spec

Design specification for the git diff viewer feature in the parsidion-cc web visualizer, enabling users to browse version history and compare commits for vault notes.

**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Project:** parsidion-cc visualizer
**Status:** Implemented

---

## Overview

Add a git diff viewer to the web visualizer that lets users browse version history for any vault note and compare any two commits with syntax-highlighted diffs. Accessible via a toolbar button in the ReadingPane and right-click context menus on file explorer entries and graph nodes.

---

## Architecture

### Approach

A new top-level `HistoryView` component replaces `ReadingPane` when history mode is active. `useVisualizerState` gets a `historyMode` boolean and `historyNote` stem; `page.tsx` conditionally renders `HistoryView` or `ReadingPane` based on this flag.

### New Components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `HistoryView` | Full split-screen container — commits left, diff right |
| `CommitList` | Scrollable list of commits with FROM/TO selection |
| `DiffViewer` | Renders diff in unified / side-by-side / word-diff modes |

### New API Routes

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/note/history` | GET `?stem=<stem>` or `?path=<path>` | Returns git log for the note file |
| `/api/note/diff` | GET `?stem=<stem>&from=<hash>&to=<hash>` or `?path=<path>&from=<hash>&to=<hash>` | Returns diff between two commits |

Both routes accept either `stem` (filename without `.md`) or `path` (vault-relative path like `Daily/MANIFEST.md`). The `path` parameter is preferred when multiple notes share the same stem in different folders.

Both routes shell out to git inside `VAULT_ROOT`. Both routes must verify the resolved file path starts with `VAULT_ROOT` before executing any git command (path traversal protection, same pattern as the existing `guardPath()` in `/api/note/route.ts`).

### State additions to `useVisualizerState`

```typescript
historyMode: boolean
historyNote: string | null        // stem of note being viewed
historyPath: string | null        // vault-relative path for disambiguation (optional)
openHistory: (stem: string, notePath?: string) => void
closeHistory: () => void
```

`openHistory` saves the current `viewMode` into a `prevViewModeRef` before setting `historyMode: true`. The optional `notePath` parameter allows disambiguating notes with the same stem in different folders. `closeHistory` restores `viewMode` from `prevViewModeRef` and clears `historyMode`, `historyNote`, and `historyPath`.

## UI Layout

### HistoryView (split-screen)

└─────────────────┴──┴──────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

### Commit List (left panel, 240px)

- Header: "COMMITS · N total"
- Each row: FROM/TO badge (blue/green when selected), short hash, commit message (truncated), relative timestamp
- Click behaviour:
  - Each commit row has two distinct clickable badges: **[FROM]** and **[TO]** (shown as small buttons on hover, always shown when that commit is selected)
  - Clicking **[FROM]** on any commit sets it as the FROM reference; clicking **[TO]** sets it as TO
  - FROM and TO cannot be the same commit — setting FROM to the current TO automatically clears TO (and vice versa)
  - Default on open: FROM = latest commit, TO = previous commit
- Scrollable, supports any number of commits

### Diff Viewer (right panel)

**Header strip:** `+N additions  −N deletions  filename.md`

**Three render modes (toggle in HistoryView toolbar, default: SPLIT):**

1. **UNIFIED** — single column, lines prefixed `+` / `-`, context lines in between. Line numbers on left.
2. **SPLIT** — two columns side by side: FROM left, TO right, aligned line-by-line. Line numbers on each side. Red background on removed lines (left), green background on added lines (right).
3. **WORDS** — full document shown with changed words highlighted inline. Red strikethrough for removed words, green for added words. No line-level coloring.

All modes: monospace font, scrollable, respects the existing dark sci-fi color scheme (`#0C0F1E` background, `#ef4444` deletions, `#4CAF50` additions, `#555` context).

---

## API Design

### GET `/api/note/history?stem=<stem>` or `?path=<path>`

Accepts either:
- `stem` — filename without `.md` extension (e.g., `my-note`)
- `path` — vault-relative path (e.g., `Daily/2026-03/23-username.md`)

Runs:
```bash
git log --follow --format="%H|%ai|%s" -- <resolved_filepath>
```
inside `VAULT_ROOT`.

Response:
```typescript
interface CommitEntry {
  hash: string       // full SHA
  shortHash: string  // first 7 chars
  date: string       // ISO 8601
  message: string    // commit subject
}
// Returns: { commits: CommitEntry[] }
```

Returns empty `commits: []` if the file has no git history (not an error). Returns `{ commits: [] }` if `VAULT_ROOT` is not a git repository.

### GET `/api/note/diff?stem=<stem>&from=<hash>&to=<hash>` or `?path=<path>&from=<hash>&to=<hash>`

Accepts either `stem` or `path` (same as history route), plus:
- `from` and `to` are full or short git SHAs. The special value `working` for `to` means the current on-disk file (uncommitted working tree).
- Git commands used:
  - Normal case (both SHAs): `git diff <from> <to> -- <filepath>`
  - Working tree case (`to=working`): `git diff <from> -- <filepath>` (no second SHA; diffs committed state vs working tree)
- Returns raw unified diff string; parsing into hunks happens client-side.
- The file header lines (`--- a/...`, `+++ b/...`) are included in the raw output. The client-side parser strips them before building the `DiffHunk[]` model.

Response:
```typescript
{ diff: string, truncated: boolean }   // raw unified diff output + truncation flag
```

When the diff exceeds 5000 lines, `truncated: true` is returned and the diff is capped.

## Entry Points (Triggering History Mode)

### 1. ReadingPane toolbar button

Add a "HISTORY" button to the existing toolbar row in `ReadingPane`. On click: `openHistory(activeStem, node.path)`.

### 2. File Explorer right-click context menu

Add a context menu to file items in `FileExplorer`. Right-clicking a file shows:
- Open
- **View History** → `openHistory(stem, path)`
- Delete

### 3. Graph node right-click

Add a right-click handler to `GraphCanvas` nodes. Shows context menu:
- Open in Reading Pane
- **View History** → `openHistory(stem)` (graph nodes use stem only since path is derived from graph.json)

---

## Diff Parsing (Client-side)

Parse the raw unified diff string into a structured hunk model for rendering:

```typescript
interface DiffLine {
  type: 'add' | 'remove' | 'context'
  content: string
  oldLineNo: number | null
  newLineNo: number | null
}

interface DiffHunk {
  header: string   // @@ -L,N +L,N @@
  lines: DiffLine[]
}
```

For WORDS mode, apply a secondary word-level diff on changed line pairs using the [`diff`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/diff) npm package (`diffWords` function). This package is already used in similar Next.js projects and provides Myers-based word diffing with no extra setup. Install with `bun add diff` + `bun add -d @types/diff`.

## Error & Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|---|---|
| File not in git history | Show "No version history found" empty state |
| Git not available | Show "Git not available in vault" with instructions |
| Single commit | FROM is auto-selected and shown read-only. TO selection is disabled. Show "Only one version — no diff available." The diff panel shows the full file content (no `+`/`-` lines) as a reference view. |
| Binary or very large diff | Cap at 5000 lines with "diff truncated" notice |
| `from === to` | Show "Select two different commits to compare" |
| VAULT_ROOT not a git repo | API returns `{ commits: [] }`, UI shows empty state |

## Files to Create / Modify

### New files
- `visualizer/app/api/note/history/route.ts`
- `visualizer/app/api/note/diff/route.ts`
- `visualizer/components/HistoryView.tsx`
- `visualizer/components/CommitList.tsx`
- `visualizer/components/DiffViewer.tsx`
- `visualizer/lib/parseDiff.ts`

### Modified files
- `visualizer/lib/useVisualizerState.ts` — add `historyMode`, `historyNote`, `historyPath`, `openHistory`, `closeHistory`
- `visualizer/app/page.tsx` — render `HistoryView` instead of `ReadingPane` when `historyMode` is true; pass `historyPath` to `HistoryView`
- `visualizer/components/ReadingPane.tsx` — add HISTORY button to toolbar
- `visualizer/components/FileExplorer.tsx` — add right-click context menu with Open, View History, Delete options
- `visualizer/components/GraphCanvas.tsx` — add right-click handler on nodes with Open in Reading Pane, View History options

---

## Out of Scope

- Restoring / reverting a note to a previous version (read-only history view only)
- Diffing across branches
- Showing diffs for notes outside `VAULT_ROOT`
- Authentication / permissions (single-user local tool)
